# plant_treaty_codebase

This repository stores code used in the Plant Treaty project with CGIAR. 

Data used in the project is stored at [insert url here].

Note: for jsonl_patterns and similar files please add the date as DDMMYYY to the end of the file name so we can keep track
of the latest versions of pattern or thesaurus sets as it is difficult to do otherwise. All lowercase and underscores in file names
please. 

## Spacy-prodigy

- spacy-prodigy 
- spacy-llm working code
- packages and models
- assets (entity ruler pattern files, small jsonl examples to get code running, thesaurii being mindful of size)

## Spark

We may need to break data into paragraphs using spark and that code should be stored here. 

## Training Data

At a certain point training data will become large and will need to be stored in the data repository. The URL for download will need to 
be provided in the project.yml for download where using spacy/prodigy. Please be aware of this.
